                    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Peer Review</li>
                        <li>A culture of open criticism</li>
                        <li>Open Discussion and Exploration</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                As an agent I am more likely to resepct the optinions of my peers than
                an outsider QA Analyst.

                Impower a culture of open criticism
                - When people know exactly what I say, social pressures encourage me
                to provide friendly, warm, and positive feedback.
                - My co-workers are my friends. I should give honest and accurate feedback.

                Agent Usage
                - I can see how I perform relative to my peers.
                - I can provide honest feedback to my peers.
                - I can see a clear path to improve myself.

                Notifications are critical to engagement

                Feedback should be monitored and moderated by the supervisor but
                not controlled. Agent's should feel liberated, not as if they
                are operating under a tightly controlled authoritarian environment.
                Supervisors will be given severely limited tools to engage in 
                feedback to prevent abuse of authority.

                The tool is largely decentralized. It is open and self monitoring.
                The community is empowered not the management.

                Comments and feedback are public.

                Focus on The Socratic Method.

                - The Status Quo
                    - My team is not experienced or skilled enough to give honest
                    and accurate feedback.
                    - The QA Analyst knows best.
                    - Information is limited. Evaluations are only shared between
                    agent, supervisor, and QA analyst.
                    - Approach feels authoritarian and cold.
                    - Agents may not feel engaged or take ONLY the QA seriously.
                    - Prone to rigging/gaming the system.
                    - Prone to human bias via the analyst or supervisor.
                    - Only a single source of input.


                - Features
                    - Advanced QA pairing engine to pair high performing agents
                    with lower performing agents. Split down to granular levels.
                    - A strong notification engine to keep agent's engaged into
                    the system.
                    - Tightly monitored communication channels that are public
                    and moderated.
                    - A quantative scoring model on calls. Scores range between
                    1 and 5 stars for each specific metrics.
                    - A configurable metrics model.
                    - A configurable forms model.
                    - A configurable goals and rewards model.

                - Notifications
                    - You have been assigned a new call to review
                    - Someone has finished reviewing your call
                    - Someone has started reviewing your call
                    - Someone has commented on your call
                    - A discussion is forming around a comments
                    - Someone has upvoted/liked your comment
                    - Someone has "boo"d your call.
                    - Someone has replied to your comment
                    - Someone on the team scored very highly.
                    - Supervisor sent you a private message.
                    - Recieved special mention from supervisor.
                    - Somone on the team recieved special mention from supervisor.
                    - A team member has achieved a goal, reward, or recoginition.
                    - Someone has tagged your call with X.
                    - You have recieved a new Badge.
                    - You have gained in rank on the leaderboard.
                    - You have lost in rank on the leaderboard.
                
                - Communication Channels
                    - Supervisor &lt;-&gt; Agent is Public or Private depending on context
                    - Agent &lt;-&gt; Agent is ONLY Public

                Supervisor Abilities
                    - I can moderate discussion.
                    - I can provie positive feedback to my team.
                    - I can monitor metrics and configure rewards and goals.

                Goals / Reward Model
                    - Each goal carries with it an assigned number of points.
                    - These points are public and expire after 30 days(rolling).
                    - A leaderboard ranks the top X employees + the current user.
                    - All rewards and scores are "rolling" requiring continuous quality from agents.

                Punishment / Penalty Model
                    - Punishments should be light but create negativate emotion.
                    - Agents are given 3 "boo"s a week they can assign to calls.
                    - A boo shows as a private message to another agent.
                    - The message is one of many predefined statements.
                    - Boo's are anonymous. Agent's do not know who sent them.
                    - Punishment prevents boredom and makes reward more appealing.

                Badges Model
                    - Inspired from LinkedIn's Skills Endorsements
                    - Agents can tag other agents calls with predefinied tag types.
                    - They can be either positive or negative.
                    - Both positive and negative tags identify who assigned them.
                    - After X amount of tags are recieved the agent recieves a 
                    corresponding badge to display proudly on their profile.
                    - Badges and Tags are "rolling" requiring continuous quality from agents.

                What I need to make this happen?
                - A team of 4 people consisting on 2 developers, 1 designer, and myself.
                - Access to Call Copy resources, including marketing, sales, product knowledge,
                 trade secrets, support etc.
                - Access to Call Copy competitior and market research.
                - Absolute faith and trust in my and my team's ability to deliver.
                - I would like to build this as a startup, funded by Call Copy, 
                it's investors, and it's partners.
                - $160k will provide 6 months of operating capital.
                - $200k - $500k investment after 6 months will make us sustainable.
